## Installation

```
- npm i
- npm start

## Usage

This application allows you to add a pet to your profile (or several), track your spending, and monitor your to-do list. In the future we are hoping to add logging technology to allow the user to track vet appointments, feeding, and more.

## Motivation

We love our pets, and we know every pet parent wants to do the most for their family member. Being able to track spending and staying organize can help improve the quality of life while making decisions to add new family members even easier.
